    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>There is nothing more American than apple pie. Except maybe that unusual trend of putting a slice of American cheese on top of a slice of apple pie—but we don't need to go there. We prefer to stick to the basics, and the perfect dessert for any summer
        or fall gathering is the classic apple pie. </p>

        Image result for about apple pie recipe It is widely understood that a “perfect” apple pie should contain apples that are still a bit firm after being cooked, that they should not be too mushy, and that you should get a good mix of tart apples and sweet
        apples.

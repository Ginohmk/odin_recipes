    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>When you’re dealing with a large piece of lean meat like a whole turkey, it’s easy to overcook it into a dry, unappealing texture. Also, just seasoning it right before cooking means there’s no time for the salt to penetrate into the meat, especially
        for thick cuts.</p>
    <p>
        Brining, or soaking a piece of meat in salty seasoned water, is a way to inject both flavor and moisture at the same time.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (15 pound) whole turkey, neck an giblets removed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 onin, cut intp wedges</li>
        <li>4 stalk celery, halved</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat turkey dry with paper towels. Season the inside and outside of turkey with kosher salt, focusing on the breast and thighs. Place turkey, breast-side up, in the roasting pan and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate turkey for about 2 days.
        </li>
        <li>Flip turkey breast-side down, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for about 1 more day.</li>
        <li>Remove plastic wrap and place turkey on a rack over a baking sheet the night before you plan to roast. Allow turkey to air-dry in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours.</li>
        <li>Bring turkey to room temperature, 1 to 2 hours; pat dry with paper towels. Season turkey with black pepper and place onion and celery in the cavity.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place turkey, breast-side down, in a roasting pan.

        </li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until skin is golden, about 30 minutes. Remove turkey from oven and flip to breast-side up. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C); continue roasting until an instant-read thermometer inserted into
            the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Transfer turkey to a large platter and loosely tent with aluminum foil; allow turkey to rest about 30 minutes before carving.</li>
    </ol>
